In exploratory data analysis (EDA), the target variable is the variable that the analysis is trying to predict or explain. It is also sometimes referred to as the dependent variable, response variable, or outcome variable.

The target variable is usually identified at the beginning of the analysis, and the goal of the analysis is to understand the relationship between the target variable and the other variables in the dataset. This often involves visualizing the distribution of the target variable, exploring how it varies with other variables, and identifying any patterns or trends in the data.

For example, in a dataset of housing prices, the target variable might be the sale price of each house, while the other variables might include the number of bedrooms, the size of the lot, the neighborhood, and so on. The EDA would focus on understanding how the sale price varies with each of these other variables, and identifying any factors that might influence the price.

In general, the target variable is a crucial part of any data analysis, as it defines the problem that the analysis is trying to solve and provides a basis for evaluating the performance of any models or algorithms that are developed.
