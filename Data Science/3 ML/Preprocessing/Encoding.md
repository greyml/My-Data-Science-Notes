**Encoding in machine learning is the process of converting categorical data into numerical data. This is necessary because most machine learning algorithms only work with numerical data.** There are many different encoding techniques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common encoding techniques include:

- **[[Label encoding]]:** This is the simplest encoding technique. Each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if the categories are "red", "green", and "blue", then red might be assigned the value 0, green might be assigned the value 1, and blue might be assigned the value 2.
- **[[One-hot encoding]]:** This technique creates a new column for each category. The value in each column is 1 if the category is present and 0 if it is not. For example, if the categories are "red", "green", and "blue", then the one-hot encoded data would have three new columns: one for red, one for green, and one for blue. If the current value is red, then the value in the red column would be 1 and the values in the green and blue columns would be 0.
- **[[Ordinal encoding]]:** This technique assigns numerical values to categories based on their order. For example, if the categories are "low", "medium", and "high", then low might be assigned the value 1, medium might be assigned the value 2, and high might be assigned the value 3.
