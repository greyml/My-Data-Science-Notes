Target guided ordinal encoding (TGO) is a type of ordinal encoding that uses the target variable to guide the encoding process. This means that the values of the target variable are used to determine the order of the categories.

TGO is a more sophisticated approach to ordinal encoding than simple label encoding. Label encoding simply assigns each category a unique integer value, regardless of the order of the categories. This can lead to problems if the categories are not ordered in a meaningful way.

TGO solves this problem by using the target variable to order the categories. This ensures that the categories are ordered in a way that is meaningful to the target variable.

TGO is a relatively new technique, but it has been shown to be effective in improving the performance of machine learning models.

Here are the steps involved in target guided ordinal encoding:

1. **Calculate the mean target value for each category.**
2. **Assign each category a value equal to its mean target value.**

For example, if the categories are "red", "blue", and "green", and the mean target values are 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9, respectively, then the encoded values would be 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.
