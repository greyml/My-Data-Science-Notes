Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns to map inputs to desired outputs based on a **given set of labelled data**. In other words, the algorithm is given a set of inputs and outputs and learns to predict the output for new inputs that it has not seen before.

Let's say we want to build a model that predicts the price of a house based on its features, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. In supervised learning, we would start by gathering a dataset of labeled examples, which would include information on the features of a house as well as the actual price it sold for. The model would then learn to predict the price of a new house based on its features.

Supervised learning is different from other types of machine learning, such as unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, because it relies on labeled data to train the algorithm. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves finding patterns and structure in data without any labeled examples. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward.

We should use supervised learning when we have a labeled dataset and want to build a model that can make accurate predictions on new data. Some common applications of supervised learning include image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

### Types of Supervised Learning Algorithms: 

There are several types of supervised learning algorithms, including regression and classification. [[Regression algorithm]]s are used to predict a continuous output variable, such as predicting the price of a house. [[Classification Algorithm]]s, on the other hand, are used to predict a categorical output variable, such as predicting whether an email is spam or not.
