Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) are both metrics used to evaluate the accuracy of a machine learning model. They are both calculated by taking the average of the errors between the predicted values and the actual values.

The main difference between MAE and MSE is that MAE uses the absolute value of the errors, while MSE uses the square of the errors. This means that MAE is less sensitive to large errors than MSE.

One advantage of MAE is that it is easier to interpret than MSE. The MAE is simply the average of the absolute errors, while the MSE is the average of the squared errors. This makes it easier to understand how well the model is performing.

Another advantage of MAE is that it is less sensitive to outliers than MSE. Outliers are data points that are very different from the rest of the data. MAE is less affected by outliers than MSE because it does not square the errors.

One disadvantage of MAE is that it is not as robust as MSE. Robustness means that a metric is not affected by noise in the data. MSE is more robust than MAE because it is less affected by outliers.

Another disadvantage of MAE is that it is not as sensitive to small errors as MSE. This means that MAE may not be able to detect small errors in the model.

Overall, MAE and MSE are both useful metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a machine learning model. The choice of which metric to use depends on the specific application. If it is important to be able to interpret the metric and to be less sensitive to outliers, then MAE is a good choice. If it is important to be robust and to be sensitive to small errors, then MSE is a good choice.

### Advantages:
1. Robust to outliers
2. It is same unit as it's values

### Disadvantages:
1. Time complexity is more for Optimization.
2.
