Ridge regression is a technique used in linear regression analysis to address the problem of multicollinearity, which occurs when the independent variables in a model are highly correlated. Multicollinearity can cause the estimated coefficients in a linear regression model to be unstable or unpredictable. **Ridge regression solves this problem by adding a penalty term to the least squares equation that shrinks the coefficients towards zero, which helps to stabilize the estimates.**

The main advantage of ridge regression over simple linear regression is that it can improve the accuracy of the estimates by reducing the variance of the coefficients. In other words, it can help to reduce overfitting in the model, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

The math behind ridge regression involves adding a penalty term to the least squares equation. The ridge regression coefficient estimates are obtained by minimizing the following objective function:

RSS + λ∑(βi^2)

where RSS is the residual sum of squares, λ is a tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty, and βi is the coefficient estimate for the ith predictor variable. The penalty term ∑(βi^2) is the sum of the squared coefficients, which encourages the coefficients to be small. The tuning parameter λ controls the balance between fitting the data well and keeping the coefficients small.

The important terms in ridge regression are:

-   Residual sum of squares (RSS): The sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.
-   Coefficient estimates (βi): The estimated values of the regression coefficients for each predictor variable in the model.
-   Penalty term (λ): The tuning parameter that controls the strength of the penalty on the coefficient estimates.
-   Ridge regression equation: The equation used to estimate the coefficients in the model, which includes the penalty term.

Overall, ridge regression is a useful technique for improving the accuracy and stability of linear regression models when dealing with multicollinearity.
