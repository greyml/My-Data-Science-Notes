 Main aim of any regression algorithm is to find the best fit line. 


-------
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a [[dependent variable]] (also known as the response variable, regressand) and one or more [[independent variables ]](also known as predictor variables, regressor). The goal of regression analysis is to estimate the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which can then be used to predict future values of the dependent variable.

Regression analysis can be used when we want to understand how a change in one or more independent variables affects the dependent variable. For example, we might use regression analysis to understand how changes in temperature affect ice cream sales, or how changes in advertising spending affect revenue.

There are several types of regression analysis, but the two main types are:

1.  [[Simple Linear Regression]]: This is used when there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and one independent variable. For example, we might use simple linear regression to model the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.
    
2.  [[Multiple Linear Regression]]: This is used when there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and multiple independent variables. For example, we might use multiple linear regression to model the relationship between advertising spending, price, and revenue.
    

Other types of regression analysis include logistic regression, which is used when the dependent variable is categorical, and polynomial regression, which is used when the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is nonlinear.

## Different Types of Regression Algorithms:
[[Simple Linear Regression]]
[[Lasso Regression]]
[[Elastic Net Regression]]
[[Ridge Regression]]
[[Logistic Regression]]
