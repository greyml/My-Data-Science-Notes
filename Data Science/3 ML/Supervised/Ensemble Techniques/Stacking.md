Stacking, also known as **stacked generalization**, is an ensemble learning technique in data science. It involves combining multiple predictive models to obtain a more accurate and robust prediction.

In stacking, instead of simply averaging the predictions of individual models, a **meta-model** is trained to make predictions based on the outputs of these models. The meta-model takes the predictions from the base models as input features and learns how to best combine them to make the final prediction. This way, the strengths of different models can be leveraged to improve the overall predictive performance.

#### The stacking process typically consists of the following steps:

1. **Base Model Training**: Each base model is trained independently on the training data.
2. **Base Model Prediction**: The trained base models make predictions on the validation data (or test data) that were not used during their training.
3. **Creating a Stacking Dataset**: The predictions from the base models, along with the original features, are combined to create a new dataset that serves as the input for the meta-model.
4. **Meta-Model Training**: The meta-model is trained on the stacking dataset, using the base model predictions as features and the corresponding target values as the target variable.
5. **Final Prediction**: The trained meta-model is then used to make the final prediction on new, unseen data.

Stacking can be useful in situations where you have a collection of diverse base models that perform well on different aspects of the data. By combining their predictions, you can potentially achieve better performance than any individual model. Stacking is particularly beneficial when the base models have low correlation, as this allows the meta-model to learn from their diverse perspectives.

### Pros n Cons: 

Pros:

- Improved predictive performance: Stacking can lead to higher accuracy and better generalisation compared to using individual models alone.
- Model combination: Stacking allows you to combine the strengths of different models, leveraging their diverse approaches to problem-solving.
- Flexibility: You can experiment with various base models and meta-models to find the best combination for your specific problem.

Cons:

- Complexity: Implementing stacking can be more complex than using a single model, as it involves training multiple models and creating a meta-model.
- Computational resources: Stacking requires more computational resources due to training multiple models and performing additional predictions.
- Overfitting risk: If not properly implemented, stacking can lead to overfitting, especially if the base models and meta-model are trained on the same data.
