Bagging is a  [[Ensemble Techniques]] which is a Combination of [[Boot Strapping]] and [[Aggregation]]. It uses multiple models parallaly. 

![[Bagging.excalidraw | 1000]]
### Steps:

1. We take Big Dataset and take lot of subsets from it randomly (i.e. random columns and random rows, which is nothing but bootstrapping.)
2. In Bagging we apply Homogeneous Model ( i.e. Same model ) on each of the bootstrapped datasets.  
3. Then we do Aggregation of all the predictions and we choose the most voted Prediction. 
4. When we specifically use Decision Trees as our model in bagging it is called as Random Forest.
