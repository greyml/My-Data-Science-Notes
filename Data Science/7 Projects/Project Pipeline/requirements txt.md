The requirements.txt file is a plain text file used in Python projects to specify the dependencies required by the project. This file contains a list of the required Python packages along with their version numbers, and can be used by the pip package manager to install all the necessary dependencies.

To create a requirements.txt file, you can use the pip freeze command. This command outputs a list of all the installed packages and their versions, which you can then redirect to a file using the output redirection operator ">".

Here's an example of how to create a requirements.txt file for a Python project:

1.  Activate your Python virtual environment (if you are using one) using the command `source path/to/venv/bin/activate`.
    
2.  Navigate to the root directory of your project.
    
3.  Run the following command to generate the requirements.txt file:
    

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

This will create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory, containing a list of all the installed packages and their versions.

To install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, you can use the following pip command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This command tells pip to install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file. By using the requirements.txt file, you can ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed on your development machine or on your production server.

> we write `-e .` in requirement.txt so we can trigger [[setup.py]] file while installing packages
