The `exception.py` file is used to define custom exceptions or error classes specific to your data science project. In software development, exceptions are used to handle and communicate error conditions or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of your code. By creating custom exceptions in a `exception.py` file, you can define and organize the specific types of errors that are relevant to your project. This allows you to provide more meaningful and informative error messages, customize exception handling behavior, and improve code readability and maintainability.
