**Keep the code which is Reusable throughout the project. This code is mostly generic one.**

The `utils.py` file is a common convention used in data science projects to store utility functions or helper code that is used across multiple modules or scripts within the project. These utility functions typically provide common functionality that is not specific to a particular task or domain. Examples of utility functions might include data preprocessing functions, feature engineering helpers, data visualization functions, or common mathematical operations. By collecting such functions in a `utils.py` file, you can keep your codebase organized, **reusable, and modular**.
