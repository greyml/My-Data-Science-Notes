The `logger.py` file is used to configure and manage logging in a data science project. Logging is an essential aspect of software development, including data science, as it allows you to record important events, errors, and debugging information during the execution of your code. The `logger.py` file typically defines a logger object that is initialized with the desired logging configuration, such as log levels, log formats, and log destinations (e.g., console, file). It provides functions or methods to write log messages at different severity levels, such as debug, info, warning, error, or critical. By centralizing the logging configuration in a `logger.py` file, you can easily control and customize the logging behavior throughout your project.
