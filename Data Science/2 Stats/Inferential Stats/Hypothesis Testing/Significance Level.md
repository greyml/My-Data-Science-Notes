    - Significance Level

        In statistics, the significance level, denoted by alpha (Î±), is the probability threshold that is used to determine whether a result is statistically significant or not. It is typically set at a value of 0.05 or 0.01, which means that there is a 5% or 1% chance, respectively, of observing the result by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
        
        The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no significant difference between two groups or no significant effect of a particular treatment or intervention. The significance level is used to compare the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining the observed results or more extreme results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
        
        If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, then the result is considered statistically significant, which means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. If the p-value is greater than the significance level, then the result is not statistically significant, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
