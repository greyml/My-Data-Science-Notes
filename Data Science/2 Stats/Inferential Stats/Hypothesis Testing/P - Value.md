 The p-value is a measure of the ==strength of evidence against the null hypothesis==. The ==null hypothesis== is a statement that assumes there is no effect or relationship between two variables or groups in a population.

The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed result if there is no true effect or relationship in the population.

Typically, a p-value is compared to a predetermined significance level (often 0.05) to determine whether the result is statistically significant or not. ==If the p-value is less than the significance level, the result is considered statistically significant, which means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, and the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis.== If the p-value is greater than the significance level, the result is not statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.

It is important to note that the p-value does not provide information about the size or importance of the effect or relationship. It only provides information about the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.
