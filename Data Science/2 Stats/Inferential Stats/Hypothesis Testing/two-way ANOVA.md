Two-way ANOVA is used when there are two independent variables (also known as factors) and we want to examine how each factor influences the dependent variable and whether there is an interaction effect between the two factors on the dependent variable.

The null hypothesis for two-way ANOVA is that there is no significant difference among the means of the groups or levels formed by the combination of the two factors.

Here is an example Python code for performing a two-way ANOVA using the `statsmodels` library:

```python

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('my_dataset.csv')

# Fit the two-way ANOVA model
model = ols('dependent_variable ~ factor1 + factor2 + factor1:factor2', data=data).fit()

# Perform ANOVA table calculations
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)

# Print the ANOVA table
print(anova_table)

```

In this code, we first load the dataset using the pandas library. We then fit the two-way ANOVA model using the `ols()` function from `statsmodels.formula.api`. The formula specifies the dependent variable and the two independent variables, as well as their interaction term. The `fit()` method fits the model to the data.

We then use the `sm.stats.anova_lm()` function to calculate the ANOVA table. The `typ` parameter specifies the type of sum of squares method to use for the calculations.

Finally, we print the ANOVA table using the `print()` function. The ANOVA table provides information about the sum of squares, degrees of freedom, F-value, and p-value for each factor and the interaction term. We can use this information to determine whether each factor and the interaction term have a significant effect on the dependent variable.
