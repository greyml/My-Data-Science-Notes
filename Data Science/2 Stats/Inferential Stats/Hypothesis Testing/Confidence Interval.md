A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It is a statistical tool used to estimate the unknown population parameter (such as the mean or proportion) based on a sample from that population.

To construct a confidence interval, we start with a point estimate of the population parameter (such as the sample mean or proportion) and then determine the range of values around that point estimate that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. The level of confidence is typically expressed as a percentage, such as 90%, 95%, or 99%.

For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of a population based on a sample of individuals, we can construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean. The confidence interval would provide a range of values around the sample mean that we can be 95% confident contains the true population mean. If we repeat the sampling and construct 95% confidence intervals many times, we would expect that about 95% of these intervals would contain the true population mean.

Confidence intervals are useful because they provide information about the precision and reliability of our estimates of population parameters based on sample data. They can be used to make inferences about population parameters and to test hypotheses about the values of those parameters.
