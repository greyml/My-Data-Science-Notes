In statistics, the z-score (also known as the standard score) is a measure that quantifies how many standard deviations an observation or data point is away from the mean of a distribution. It is used to standardize and compare values from different normal distributions




The formula for calculating the z-score is:

z = (x - μ) / σ

Where:

- x is the individual data point or observation
- μ is the mean of the distribution
- σ is the standard deviation of the distribution

The resulting z-score tells us the number of standard deviations the data point is above or below the mean. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates it is below the mean.

The z-score allows us to assess the relative position of a data point within a distribution, regardless of the specific units or scales of the data. It is often used in hypothesis testing, determining outliers, comparing data across different distributions, and identifying extreme or unusual observations.

Additionally, the z-score can be used to calculate percentiles or probabilities associated with a particular value or range in a normal distribution using a z-table or statistical software.
