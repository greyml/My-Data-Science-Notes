- Uniform Distribution
    - [Discrete Uniform Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution)
        
        The discrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a discrete event with a finite number of equally likely possibilities.
        
        Here are the key components of the discrete uniform distribution:
        
        1. Definition: The discrete uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes the outcomes of a discrete event with a finite number of equally likely possibilities. Examples include rolling a fair die or choosing a card from a well-shuffled deck.
        2. Parameter: The discrete uniform distribution is characterized by two parameters, a and b, which are the lower and upper bounds of the range of possible outcomes.
        3. Probability Mass Function (PMF): The probability mass function of the discrete uniform distribution gives the probability of each possible outcome. It is given by the formula P(X=k) = 1/(b-a+1), where k is a possible outcome between a and b.
        4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The cumulative distribution function of the discrete uniform distribution gives the probability that the outcome is less than or equal to a certain value. It is given by the formula F(X<=k) = (k-a+1)/(b-a+1), where k is a possible outcome between a and b.
        5. Mean and Variance: The mean of the discrete uniform distribution is (a+b)/2, and the variance is (b-a+1)^2/12.
        6. Properties: The discrete uniform distribution satisfies the properties of a probability distribution, such as non-negativity, normalization, and the law of total probability. It is also a special case of the more general uniform distribution.
        7. Applications: The discrete uniform distribution is used in a variety of applications, such as generating random numbers with equal probability between a and b, and modeling the probabilities of equally likely outcomes in various experiments and games. For example, it can be used to model the probability of a certain number coming up in a roll of a fair die or the likelihood of a specific card being drawn from a deck of cards.
    - [Continuous Uniform Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)
        
        The continuous uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes a random variable that has an equal probability of taking on any value within a specified interval.
        
        Here are the key components of the continuous uniform distribution:
        
        1. Definition: The continuous uniform distribution is a probability distribution that describes a random variable that has an equal probability of taking on any value within a specified interval. Examples include the height of a person selected at random from a given range, or the amount of time it takes to complete a task.
        2. Parameters: The continuous uniform distribution is characterized by two parameters, a and b, which are the lower and upper bounds of the interval. The distribution is denoted as U(a,b).
        3. Probability Density Function (PDF): The probability density function of the continuous uniform distribution is a constant value within the specified interval and zero outside the interval. It is given by the formula f(x) = 1/(b-a), where a <= x <= b, and f(x) = 0 otherwise.
        4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The cumulative distribution function of the continuous uniform distribution is a linear function that increases from zero at x = a to one at x = b. It is given by the formula F(x) = (x-a)/(b-a), where a <= x <= b.
        5. Mean and Variance: The mean of the continuous uniform distribution is (a+b)/2, and the variance is (b-a)^2/12.
        6. Properties: The continuous uniform distribution satisfies the properties of a probability distribution, such as non-negativity, normalization, and the law of total probability. It is also a special case of the more general uniform distribution.
        7. Applications: The continuous uniform distribution is used in a variety of applications, such as modeling continuous random variables with equal probability over a specified range, generating random numbers with equal probability over a specified range, and in statistical tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
