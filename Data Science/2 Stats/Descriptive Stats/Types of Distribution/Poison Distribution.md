- [Poison Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
    - Key Idea
        1. Definition of a Distribution:
        The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of occurrences of rare events in a fixed interval of time or space. It is characterised by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of occurrence of the events.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency:
        The mean or expected value of the Poisson distribution is equal to λ, which represents the average number of events occurring in a fixed interval.
        3. Measures of Spread:
        The variance of the Poisson distribution is also equal to λ, which indicates that the spread or variability of the distribution is equal to its mean.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF):
        The PDF of the Poisson distribution is given by P(x) = (e^-λ * λ^x) / x! where x is the number of events occurring in the fixed interval. The PDF is defined for non-negative integer values of x.
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
        The CDF of the Poisson distribution is given by F(x) = ∑(k=0 to x) (e^-λ * λ^k) / k! which represents the probability that the number of events is less than or equal to x.
        6. Properties of the Distribution:
        The Poisson distribution has several important properties, including the memoryless property, which means that the probability of an event occurring in the next time interval is the same, regardless of how much time has elapsed since the last event. The distribution is also used to model rare events, where λ is small and the probability of an event occurring is low.
        7. Applications in Data Science:
        The Poisson distribution is commonly used in modeling the number of defects or errors in a production process, the number of customers arriving at a service desk, or the number of calls arriving at a call center. It is also used in actuarial science to model the number of insurance claims filed in a given period. The distribution can also be used as a building block for more complex statistical models, such as the Poisson regression model.
    - Poisson distribution is used to predict the number of events going to happen in a certain time interval.
