    - Key Ideas
        1. Definition: The Standard Normal Distribution is a special case of the normal distribution, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency: The mean, median, and mode are all zero in a standard normal distribution.
        3. Measures of Spread: The standard deviation is one in a standard normal distribution. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF of a standard normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. It is given by the formula: f(x) = (1 / √(2π)) * e^(-(x^2 / 2)).
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The CDF of a standard normal distribution is a function that gives the probability that a random variable Z is less than or equal to a certain value z. It is denoted by Φ(z) and is given by the formula: Φ(z) = (1 / √(2π)) ∫(from -∞ to z) e^(-(x^2 / 2)) dx.
        6. Properties: The Standard Normal Distribution is important because it serves as a reference distribution for many statistical tests and confidence interval calculations. Z-scores, which represent the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean, are calculated using the standard normal distribution.
        7. Applications: The Standard Normal Distribution is used extensively in hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and regression analysis. In data science, it is important to understand the properties and characteristics of the standard normal distribution, as it is often used as a benchmark for other distributions.

    - The Standard Normal Distribution is a normal distribution (also known as the z-distribution) with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
    - z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution. It is calculated by subtracting the mean from the data point and dividing the result by the standard deviation.

    - Use Case:
        1. The z-score is often used in hypothesis testing and to identify outliers in a data set. 
        2. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates that the data point is below the mean.
        3. The area under the curve between two values represents the probability of a random variable falling within that range.
