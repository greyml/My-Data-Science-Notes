- [Power Law Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)
    - Key Idea
        
        1. Definition: The Power Law Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes a random variable where the frequency of occurrence of large values follows a power law. It is also known as the "Pareto distribution," after the economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first observed the distribution in his studies of income inequality.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency: The Power Law Distribution does not have a well-defined mean or variance, as it has an infinite tail. The mode is the minimum value of x that satisfies the power law.
        3. Measures of Spread: The Power Law Distribution is characterized by two parameters, α and xmin. The parameter α is the scaling exponent of the power law, which determines the slope of the distribution on a logarithmic scale. The parameter xmin is the minimum value of x at which the power law behavior begins.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF of a Power Law Distribution is a heavy-tailed function that is characterized by its scaling exponent α and minimum value xmin. It is given by the formula: f(x) = (α - 1) * xmin^(α-1) * x^(-α), for x >= xmin.
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The CDF of a Power Law Distribution is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x. It is given by the formula: F(x) = 1 - (x/xmin)^(-α+1), for x >= xmin.
        6. Properties: The Power Law Distribution is important in many fields, including economics, biology, and computer science. It is often used to model phenomena that exhibit long-tailed distributions, such as the distribution of wealth, the size of cities, and the frequency of words in language.
        7. Applications: The Power Law Distribution is used in a variety of applications, including modeling the distribution of file sizes in peer-to-peer networks, the number of citations of scientific papers, and the frequency of words in natural language. In data science, it is important to understand the properties and characteristics of the Power Law Distribution, as it is often used to model complex systems with many interacting parts.

    - 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle. This principle states that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
    - distribution has a long tail, with a few very large values that occur with a low probability.
    - The power law is a functional relationship between two quantities where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity.
    - The distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and man-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes.
