- [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
    - Key Idea
        1. Definition: The Normal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped. It is characterized by its mean and standard deviation.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency: The mean, median, and mode are all equal in a normal distribution.
        3. Measures of Spread: The standard deviation describes the spread of a normal distribution. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF of a normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve that is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. It is given by the formula: f(x) = (1 / σ√(2π)) * e^(-(x-μ)^2 / (2σ^2)), where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The CDF of a normal distribution is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x. It is given by the formula: F(x) = Φ((x - μ) / σ), where Φ is the standard normal distribution, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
        6. Properties: The Normal Distribution is important because many real-world phenomena follow this distribution, such as heights, weights, and IQ scores. It is also useful because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean tends towards a normal distribution.
        7. Applications: The Normal Distribution is used extensively in data analysis and modeling. For example, it is used in hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and confidence interval estimation. In data science, it is important to understand the properties and characteristics of the normal distribution, as it is often assumed in many statistical models.

    - data is symmetrically distributed around a central point, with the majority of the data clustered near the center and fewer data points farther away from the center. The distribution is characterized by its mean and standard deviation, which determine the position and width of the bell curve.
    - The standard deviation of the data determines the width of the distribution.
    - The empirical rule is a statistical principle that states that for a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% of the data will fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. This principle is also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the three-sigma rule.
