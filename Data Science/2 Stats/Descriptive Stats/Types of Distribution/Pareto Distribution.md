- [Pareto Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)
    - Key Idea
        
        The Pareto Distribution, also known as the Pareto Law or Pareto Principle, is a power-law probability distribution that is used to describe phenomena that exhibit heavy-tailed distributions. Here's some more information about the Pareto Distribution:
        
        1. Definition: The Pareto Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to model variables that have a high probability of taking small values, but also have a non-zero probability of taking extremely large values. It is named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first observed the distribution in his studies of income inequality.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency: The Pareto Distribution does not have a well-defined mean or variance, as it has an infinite tail. The mode is the minimum value of x that satisfies the power law.
        3. Measures of Spread: The Pareto Distribution is characterized by two parameters, α and xmin. The parameter α is the scaling exponent of the power law, which determines the slope of the distribution on a logarithmic scale. The parameter xmin is the minimum value of x at which the power law behavior begins.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF of a Pareto Distribution is a heavy-tailed function that is characterized by its scaling exponent α and minimum value xmin. It is given by the formula: f(x) = (α * xmin^α) / x^(α+1), for x >= xmin.
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The CDF of a Pareto Distribution is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x. It is given by the formula: F(x) = 1 - (xmin / x)^α, for x >= xmin.
        6. Properties: The Pareto Distribution is important in many fields, including economics, biology, and computer science. It is often used to model phenomena that exhibit long-tailed distributions, such as the distribution of wealth, the size of cities, and the frequency of words in language.
        7. Applications: The Pareto Distribution is used in a variety of applications, including modeling the distribution of income, the size of cities, and the frequency of words in natural language. In data science, it is important to understand the properties and characteristics of the Pareto Distribution, as it is often used to model complex systems with many interacting parts.
    - if the right-skewed distribution has a heavy-tailed nature, it is possible that it could be fitted to a Pareto Distribution. This would involve estimating the scaling exponent (α) and the minimum value (xmin) of the Pareto Distribution that would best fit the data.
