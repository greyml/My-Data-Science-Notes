- [Lognormal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution)
    - Key Idea
        1. Definition: The Lognormal Distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. It is often used to model variables that are always positive, such as the price of a stock, the size of a population, or the time it takes to complete a task.
        2. Measures of Central Tendency: The geometric mean, median, and mode are the three commonly used measures of central tendency for the lognormal distribution. The mean of a lognormal distribution is not always defined.
        3. Measures of Spread: The lognormal distribution is characterized by two parameters, the mean and the standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution of the logarithms. The standard deviation of the lognormal distribution is not the same as the standard deviation of the logarithms.
        4. Probability Density Function (PDF): The PDF of a lognormal distribution is a skewed, unimodal function that is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. It is given by the formula: f(x) = (1 / (xσ√(2π))) * e^(-(ln(x)-μ)^2 / (2σ^2)), where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the logarithm of the variable x.
        5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The CDF of a lognormal distribution is a function that gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x. It does not have a closed-form solution and is typically calculated numerically.
        6. Properties: The Lognormal Distribution is important in many fields, including finance, economics, and biology. It is often used to model variables that exhibit exponential growth, such as the growth of a population or the value of a stock over time. The lognormal distribution is also related to the normal distribution, and the lognormal transformation is a common tool in data analysis and modeling.
        7. Applications: The Lognormal Distribution is used in a variety of applications, including modeling the size of earthquakes, the distribution of income, and the duration of job searches. In data science, it is important to understand the properties and characteristics of the lognormal distribution, as it is often used to model variables that are always positive and exhibit skewed distributions.
    - A log-normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
    - The log-normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln (X) has a normal distribution.
    - A random variable that is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values.
    - It is a convenient and useful model for measurements in exact and engineering sciences, as well as medicine, economics, and other topics (e.g., energies, concentrations, lengths, prices of financial instruments, and other metrics).
