    - Key Ideas
        1. Definition: The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the outcome of a single binary event, such as the flip of a coin or the success or failure of an experiment.
        2. Parameter: The Bernoulli distribution is characterised by one parameter, p, which is the probability of the event being a success.
        3. Probability Mass Function (PMF): The probability mass function of the Bernoulli distribution gives the probability of the event being a success (1) or a failure (0). It is given by the formula P(X=k) = p^k * (1-p)^(1-k), where k can only be 0 or 1.
        4. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): The cumulative distribution function of the Bernoulli distribution gives the probability of the event being a success (1) or less. It is given by the formula F(X<=k) = 1 if k>=1, and F(X<=k) = 1-p if k=0.
        5. Mean and Variance: The mean of the Bernoulli distribution is p, and the variance is p*(1-p).
        6. Properties: The Bernoulli distribution satisfies the properties of a probability distribution, such as non-negativity, normalization, and the law of total probability. It is also a special case of the more general binomial distribution.
        7. Applications: The Bernoulli distribution is used in a variety of applications, such as modeling the success or failure of a single event in experiments and studies, such as drug trials or A/B testing. For example, it can be used to model the probability of a customer clicking on a particular advertisement, or the likelihood of a patient recovering from a certain treatment.
