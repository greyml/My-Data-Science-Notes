Noisy data refers to data that contains errors or outliers, which can affect the accuracy of statistical models and machine learning algorithms. The errors can be due to various factors such as measurement errors, human errors, technical limitations, or system malfunctions. Outliers can occur when there are extreme values or anomalies in the data that are not representative of the typical behavior.

Noisy data can have a negative impact on the performance of a model as it can lead to incorrect predictions or misinterpretation of results. To mitigate the effects of noisy data, various techniques can be employed such as data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting errors in the data, while outlier detection involves identifying and removing or treating extreme values. Feature engineering involves transforming the data or creating new features that are more representative of the underlying patterns in the data. Overall, the goal is to improve the quality of the data so that models can more accurately capture the patterns and relationships in the data.
