# Distributions

In statistics, distribution refers to the way in which a set of data is spread out or organized. 

We use distributions in statistics because they allow us to summarize and analyze large amounts of data in a meaningful way. By understanding the distribution of a dataset, we can make predictions about the likelihood of certain outcomes or events, and we can also make comparisons between different datasets.

Overall, distributions are a key tool in statistics for understanding and interpreting data, and they are used in a wide range of applications, from business and finance to science and engineering.
