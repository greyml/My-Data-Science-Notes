- Discrete Random Variable & Continuous Random Variable
    
    In summary, the main difference between discrete and continuous random variables is that a discrete random variable can only take on specific values, while a continuous random variable can take on any value within a range. Additionally, the PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, while the PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.

- definition
    - A probability distribution function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability of a random variable taking on a particular value or falling within a specific range of values.
    - The area under the PDF curve represents the total probability of all possible outcomes, which is equal to 1.
    - probability distribution function (PDF) is a general term that can refer to either a probability mass function (PMF) or a probability density function (PDF), depending on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.
