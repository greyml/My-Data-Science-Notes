The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that says if you take a large enough sample size from any population (even if the population is not normally distributed), the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal.

In simpler terms, the CLT tells us that if we take many random samples from a population, the means of those samples will tend to follow a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population.

For example, if we were to take many samples of 100 people's heights from a population, we would find that the means of those samples would follow a normal distribution, even if the original population was not normally distributed.

Why is this important? The CLT allows us to make statistical inferences about a population, based on a sample of that population. It also allows us to estimate population parameters (such as the mean or standard deviation) with greater accuracy.

In essence, the CLT provides a framework for understanding the behavior of sample means and is a powerful tool for data analysis in a wide range of fields.
