Covariance and correlation are both measures of the relationship between two variables in statistics.

Covariance measures the extent to which two variables vary together. More specifically, it measures the degree to which the deviations of two variables from their respective means are associated with one another.

$$cov(X,Y) = Σ[(X_i - X̄) * (Y_i - Ȳ)] / N$$

Covariance of X with X is nothing but variance of X ⚓. 

>A positive covariance indicates that when one variable is above its mean, the other variable tends to be above its mean as well, while a negative covariance indicates that when one variable is above its mean, the other variable tends to be below its mean. However, covariance does not provide a standardized measure of association, and its value depends on the scale of measurement of the variables.

### Covariance Vs Correlation:
[[Correlation]], on the other hand, is a standardized measure of association between two variables. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. ==The correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1==, with a correlation of +1 indicating a perfect positive relationship, a correlation of -1 indicating a perfect negative relationship, and a correlation of 0 indicating no relationship. Correlation is unitless and invariant to changes in scale of measurement of the variables.

##### Properties of Covariance:
$$COV(x,y)=COV(y,x)$$
