The five-number summary is a descriptive statistic that summarizes the distribution of a data set using five values: the minimum, the first quartile (Q1), the median (Q2), the third quartile (Q3), and the maximum. It is also sometimes referred to as the "box-and-whisker plot."

Here are the definitions of each of the five values:

1. Minimum: The smallest value in the data set.
2. Q1 (First Quartile): The value below which 25% of the data falls.
3. Q2 (Median): The value that divides the data set into two equal halves.
4. Q3 (Third Quartile): The value below which 75% of the data falls.
5. Maximum: The largest value in the data set.

To construct a box-and-whisker plot using the five-number summary, you draw a box that extends from the first quartile to the third quartile, with a line at the median. Then, you draw "whiskers" that extend from the box to the smallest and largest values that are not outliers. Outliers are values that are more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the third quartile or below the first quartile.

The five-number summary is useful for quickly summarizing the distribution of a data set and identifying any potential outliers. It can be particularly helpful in comparing multiple data sets or identifying differences in the distribution of a single data set over time.

16, 20, 25, 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 42, 50, 55, 60, 62, 66, 70, 75, 80, 85, 88, 91

Step 2: Find the minimum and maximum values:

**Minimum: 16
Maximum: 91**

Step 3: Find the median (Q2):

Median (Q2): The middle value of the data set. In this case, we have an even number of values, so we take the average of the two middle values:

**Median (Q2) = (50 + 55)/2 = 52.5**

Step 4: Find the first quartile (Q1):

When calculating the value at a certain percentile of a dataset, we often use the formula:

k = (p / 100) * (n + 1)

where:

- k is the rank of the value at the desired percentile
- p is the percentile we want to calculate
- n is the sample size of the dataset

Q1: The value below which 25% of the data falls. To find Q1, we divide the data set into two halves at the median, and then find the median of the lower half:

Lower half: 16, 20, 25, 29, 33, 35, 38, 41, 42, 50

**Median of lower half (Q1) = (33 + 35)/2 = 34**

Step 5: Find the third quartile (Q3):

Q3: The value below which 75% of the data falls. To find Q3, we divide the data set into two halves at the median, and then find the median of the upper half:

Upper half: 55, 60, 62, 66, 70, 75, 80, 85, 88, 91

Median of upper half (Q3) = (70 + 75)/2 = 72.5

So, the five-number summary for this data set is:

Minimum: 16
Q1: 34
Median (Q2): 52.5
Q3: 72.5
Maximum: 91

We can use this information to construct a box-and-whisker plot to visualize the distribution of the data set.
