### Useful Terms:
#### Variability
 In statistics, variability is an important concept because it helps us understand how spread out or similar our data is. We use different measures of variability, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, to quantify how much variability there is in our data. By understanding the variability in our data, we can make better decisions and draw more accurate conclusions about the world around us.
 
>For example, if you look at a group of people and some are very tall and some are very short, we say there is a lot of variability in their heights. On the other hand, if everyone in the group is about the same height, we say there is not much variability.
#### Robust Measures of Scale
robust measures of scale areÂ **methods that quantify the statistical dispersion in a sample of numerical data while resisting outliers**. The most common such robust statistics are the interquartile range (IQR) and the median absolute deviation (MAD).
#### Random Variable
**a random variable is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random event or experiment.** Random variables can take on discrete or continuous values, and are commonly used in statistics to describe the probability distribution of a random process or phenomenon.
