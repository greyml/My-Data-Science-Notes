The interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a dataset. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) of the dataset. In other words, IQR represents the range of the middle 50% of the data.

1. Arrange data in order
2. Find median of dataset = Q2
3. Find median of the first half of the dataset = Q1
4. Find median of the second half of the dataset = Q3
5. IQR = Q3 - Q1

	Q1 = median of first 50 % of data
	Q2 = median of 100% of data
	Q3 = median of second 50 % data

> $IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 39 - 20 = 19$

IQR can be used in a variety of statistical analyses, including box-and-whisker plots, which are graphical representations of the distribution of the data. IQR can also be used to detect and analyze differences in variability between different groups or subgroups in a dataset.

IQR is a useful measure of dispersion because it is not sensitive to outliers or extreme values in the dataset, unlike range or standard deviation. It provides a robust measure of the variability of the data that can help identify the middle 50% of the data points.

>the [[lower fence]] is defined as:
>`lower fence = Q1 - k * IQR`
>and the [[upper fence]] is defined as:
>`upper fence = Q3 + k * IQR`

where `Q1` and `Q3` are the first and third quartiles of the data, respectively, and `IQR` is the interquartile range, defined as `IQR = Q3 - Q1`. The value `k` is a constant that determines how far the fences are from the quartiles, and is typically set to **1.5** in the Tukey method.

We can identify outliers from our dataset using Upper fence and lower fence 
##### Demo Code:
```python
for k, v in data.items():

# k - Feature , v - values from that feature

q1 = v.quantile(0.25)

q3 = v.quantile(0.75)

irq = q3 - q1 # Inter Quartile Range

# | - OR

# we are creating list of elements for particular features which are outside of IQR

v_col = v[(v <= q1 - 1.5 * irq) | (v >= q3 + 1.5 * irq)]

perc = np.shape(v_col)[0] * 100.0 / np.shape(data)[0]

print("Column %s outliers = %.2f%%" % (k, perc))

```
