The range of a dataset is the difference between the largest and smallest values in that dataset. Range is easy to calculate, as it only requires finding the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. However, it can be influenced by outliers or extreme values that are far from the rest of the data. In other words, the range may not be a robust measure of dispersion, as it can be misleading in the presence of outliers.
