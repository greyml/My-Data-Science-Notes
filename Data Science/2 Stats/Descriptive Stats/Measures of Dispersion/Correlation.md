To calculate covariance and correlation, we need two sets of data. The formula for covariance is:

$$cov(X,Y) = Σ[(X_i - X̄) * (Y_i - Ȳ)] / (n - 1)$$

where Xi and Yi are the values of the two variables, X̄ and Ȳ are their respective sample means, and n is the sample size.

The formula for correlation is:
$$corr(X,Y) = cov(X,Y) / (\sigma_{x}*\sigma_{y})$$
>Where, 
>$\sigma_{x}$ - standard deviation of X
>$\sigma_{y}$ - standard deviation of Y

In summary, covariance measures how two variables vary together, while correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. While both measures are useful in understanding the relationship between two variables, **correlation is often preferred because it is standardized and more interpretable.**

> Covariance is when two variables vary with each other, whereas Correlation is when the change in one variable results in the change in another variable.
