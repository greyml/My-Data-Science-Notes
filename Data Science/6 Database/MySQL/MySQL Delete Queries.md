>**Note:**Â Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice theÂ `WHERE`Â clause in theÂ `DELETE`Â statement. TheÂ `WHERE`Â clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit theÂ `WHERE`Â clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

### Deleting Referential Integrity Violations

```mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM emp
    -> WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT DEPT_NO FROM dep);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

```

### Deleting Duplicated

```mysql
mysql> select * from dupes order by 1;
+------+----------+
| id   | name     |
+------+----------+
|    1 | napolean |
|    2 | napolean |
|    3 | napolean |
|    4 | dynamite |
|    5 | omkar    |
|    6 | omkar    |
|    8 | napolean |
+------+----------+
```

```mysql

mysql> DELETE FROM dupes WHERE id NOT IN  (SELECT MIN(id) FROM (SELECT id, name from dupes) tmp GROUP BY name);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.01 sec)

```

after deleting duplicating
```mysql

mysql> SELECT * FROM dupes;
+------+----------+
| id   | name     |
+------+----------+
|    1 | napolean |
|    4 | dynamite |

|     10 | Flesh Wound |
|     10 | Fire        |
|     30 | flood       |
+--------+-------------+
```

### `HAVING`

```mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM emp
    -> WHERE department_id IN ( SELECT deptno FROM dept_acc Group by deptno HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2);
```

```
mysql> SELECT name, department_id FROM emp;
+----------------+---------------+
| name           | department_id |
+----------------+---------------+
| Jane Smith     |          NULL |
| Sarah Williams |          NULL |
