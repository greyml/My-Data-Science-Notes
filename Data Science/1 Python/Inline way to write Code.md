Imagine you have a recipe for making a sandwich. Typically, you would follow the recipe step by step, using each instruction as a separate function or method. However, in some cases, instead of referring to the recipe repeatedly, you might decide to write the recipe steps directly into your cooking process at the appropriate points. This is similar to what "inline" means in programming.

**In programming, "inline" refers to writing code directly at the point where it is needed, instead of creating a separate function or method for it. It is like copying and pasting the code into the main program at the exact location where it is used.**

The purpose of doing this is to eliminate the need for a function call, which involves additional steps such as preparing arguments, executing the function, and returning results. By writing the code inline, you can save time and memory because the code executes directly at the location where it is written.

However, it's important to note that inlining code can have trade-offs. It can make the code longer and harder to read if used excessively. Additionally, modern compilers are often capable of automatically optimizing the code, including function inlining, based on their analysis of the program. So, in many cases, you don't need to manually inline code as the compiler can make those optimizations for you.

Just like you wouldn't always want to write the recipe steps directly in your cooking process, it's generally recommended to rely on the compiler's optimizations and use inline code sparingly and when it provides a clear benefit in terms of performance or code organization.
