A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of the class. It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and does not have access to the instance or class variables.

Static methods are not bound to any specific instance and can be called on the class itself without creating an instance of the class. They are mainly used for utility functions or operations that do not depend on instance-specific data.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of static methods:

```python

class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

result = MathUtils.add(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7

```

In the above code, the `add` method is a static method defined within the `MathUtils` class. It takes two arguments `x` and `y` and simply returns their sum. Since it is a static method, it can be directly called on the class itself without creating an instance of the class. In this case, we call `MathUtils.add(3, 4)` to get the result of adding 3 and 4, which is 7.

Static methods are useful when you have a method that is related to a class but does not require access to instance-specific data. They provide a way to organise utility functions or operations within a class without tying them to specific instances.
