decorators are a powerful feature that allow you to modify the behaviour of functions, methods, or classes **without directly changing their source code**. Decorators provide a way to wrap or enhance the functionality of a target object by adding additional code before or after its execution.

By using decorators, you can keep your code **modular**, **reusable**, and easier to maintain. Decorators provide a clean and elegant way to extend or modify the functionality of objects without modifying their original source code.

-----
## Types of Decorators: 
1. [[@custom_decorators]]: we can create a nested function which acts as decorator
1. `@classmethod`: Defines a class method within a class.
2. `@property`: Defines a method as a property of a class, allowing attribute-like access.
3. `@abstractmethod`: Declares an abstract method within an abstract base class.
4. [[@staticmethod]]: Defines a static method within a class.
6. `@property`: Defines a method as a property of a class, allowing attribute-like access.
7. `@abstractmethod`: Declares an abstract method within an abstract base class.
9. `@property`: Defines a method as a property of a class, allowing attribute-like access.
10. `@abstractmethod`: Declares an abstract method within an abstract base class.
11. [[@dataclass]]: Automatically generates boilerplate code for classes that hold data.
12. `@functools.wraps`: Preserves the original function's metadata when defining decorators.
13. `@functools.lru_cache`: Caches the results of a function, improving its performance for repeated calls with the same arguments.
14. `@contextlib.contextmanager`: Defines a context manager using a generator function.
