The sys module in Python provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is always available.

Here are some of the most common sys module variables:

- **argv:** This is a list of command-line arguments passed to the Python interpreter.
- **builtin_module_names:** This is a list of the names of the built-in modules.
- **displayhook:** This is the function that is called to display the output of expressions.
- **excepthook:** This is the function that is called to handle exceptions.
- **exitfunc:** This is the function that is called to exit the Python interpreter.
- **executable:** This is the path to the Python interpreter executable.
- **hexversion:** This is the hexadecimal representation of the Python interpreter version.
- **maxint:** This is the largest integer value that can be represented in Python.
- **maxunicode:** This is the largest Unicode code point that can be represented in Python.
- **modules:** This is a dictionary that maps module names to module objects.
- **path:** This is a list of directories that are searched for modules.
- **platform:** This is the name of the operating system and architecture that the Python interpreter is running on.
- **ps1:** This is the prompt that is displayed before the user enters a command.
- **ps2:** This is the prompt that is displayed after the user enters a command.
- **stdin:** This is a file object that represents the standard input stream.
- **stdout:** This is a file object that represents the standard output stream.
- **stderr:** This is a file object that represents the standard error stream.
- **version:** This is the string representation of the Python interpreter version.
- **version_info:** This is a tuple that contains the major, minor, and micro version numbers of the Python interpreter.

Here are some of the most common sys module functions:

- **displayhook():** This function is called to display the output of expressions.
- **excepthook():** This function is called to handle exceptions.
- **exit():** This function is used to exit the Python interpreter.
- **getfilesystemencoding():** This function returns the encoding that is used to convert between bytes and Unicode strings on the filesystem.
- **getrecursionlimit():** This function returns the maximum number of nested function calls that are allowed.
- **setrecursionlimit():** This function sets the maximum number of nested function calls that are allowed.
- **stdin```:** This function returns a file object that represents the standard input stream.
- **stdout:** This function returns a file object that represents the standard output stream.
- **stderr:** This function returns a file object that represents the standard error stream.
- **version():** This function returns the string representation of the Python interpreter version.
- **version_info():** This function returns a tuple that contains the major, minor, and micro version numbers of the Python interpreter.

The sys module is a powerful tool that can be used to interact with the Python interpreter and the operating system. It offers a wide range of variables and functions that can be used to perform a variety of tasks.
