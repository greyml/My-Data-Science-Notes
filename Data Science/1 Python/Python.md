#### What is python? #iq 

Python is a **high-level**, **[[versatile]]**, and widely-used  **interpreted** programming language that is particularly popular in the field of data science. Python is also know as OOP language.

It's known for its **simplicity** and **readability**. 

##### Some Terms
1. **High Level:** A high-level programming language, like Python, is designed to be human-readable and easy to understand. It abstracts complex low-level details, making it more accessible for programmers.

2. **Interpreted:** An interpreted language ==executes code line by line==, translating it to machine code as it runs. Python is an interpreted language, which contributes to its flexibility and ease of use.

3. **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which represent real-world entities. Python supports OOP, allowing you to create reusable and organized code structures for complex applications.
##### Data Science Importance:
1. Tasks Done: data manipulation, analysis, and modeling etc.
2. libraries and tools:  NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn etc.

In data science, Python is used for various tasks, such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Its flexibility and extensive community support make it a top choice for data scientists to work with large datasets, develop predictive models, and gain insights from data.

##### Other Uses
Python's versatility extends beyond data science, as it can be employed for web development, automation, and more. Its simple and elegant syntax, along with the availability of numerous resources, makes it an essential tool for both beginners and seasoned professionals in the field of data science.

In nutshell it's
- High level, Interpreted, OOP
- simplicity
- readability
- ease of integration with other languages
- extensive standard libraries
- strong community support

#### What is  PEP 8? #iq 
PEP 8 stands for "==Python Enhancement Proposal 8==." which provides recommendations and conventions on how to format your Python code to ensure consistency and maintainability in projects.

Key aspects of PEP 8 include guidelines on indentation, variable naming, line length, import formatting, and much more. [[Adhering]] to PEP 8 helps make your code more understandable and accessible to other Python developers, as well as promotes good coding practices.
