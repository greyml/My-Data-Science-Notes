------------------------------------------

- As Python closures are used as callback functions, they provide some sort of data hiding. This helps us to reduce the use of global variables.
- When we have few functions in our code, closures in Python prove to be an efficient way. But if we need to have many functions, then go for class (OOP).
- We may have variables in the global scope that are not used by many functions at times. Instead of defining variables in global scope, consider using a closure. They can be defined in the outer function and used in the inner function. Python Closures are also useful for avoiding the use of a global scope.
- A class in the Python programming language always has the __init__ method. If you only have one extra method, an elegant solution would be to use a closure rather than a class. Because this improves code readability and even reduces the programmerâ€™s workload. Closures in Python can thus be used to avoid the needless use of a class.
