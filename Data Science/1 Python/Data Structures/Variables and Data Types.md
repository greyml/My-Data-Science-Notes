### Variables in Python:   

 A Python variable isÂ **a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.** Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name. But the data itself is still contained within the object. 
 
1. Variables are containers for storing data values.
2. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
3. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
4.  Python variable is also known as an identifier.

### Rules for choosing variable name:

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
