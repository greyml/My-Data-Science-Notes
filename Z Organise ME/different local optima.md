**Different Local Optima:** In optimization problems like clustering, there can be multiple solutions that are locally optimal. These are called "local optima." When the K-means algorithm is initialized with different starting points, it might converge to different local optima. Each local optimum represents a clustering solution that's locally best, but it might not be the globally best solution. If the initial cluster centers are placed differently, the algorithm could end up in a different local optimum, leading to varied clustering results.
