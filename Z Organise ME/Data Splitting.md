Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets is a fundamental step in the process of building and evaluating machine learning models. Each of these datasets serves a specific purpose:

1.**[[Training Data]]:**
   - **Purpose:** The training data is the largest portion of the dataset and is used to train the machine learning model.
   - **Usage:** This is where the model learns the underlying patterns, relationships, and features within the data. It adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) through various algorithms to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.
   - **Key Points:** Training data should be a representative sample of the overall dataset. A well-trained model should generalize well to unseen data.

2. **[[Validation Data]]:**
   - **Purpose:** The validation data is used to fine-tune the model and optimize its hyperparameters.
   - **Usage:** After training on the training data, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set. This helps in making adjustments to the model's hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) to improve its generalization and prevent overfitting (when the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data).
   - **Key Points:** The validation set should be separate from the training data and large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the model's performance.

3. **[[Test Data]]:**
   - **Purpose:** The test data is a dataset that the model has never seen during training or validation. It is used to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
   - **Usage:** The test set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance. It helps to gauge how well the model is expected to perform in a real-world scenario.
   - **Key Points:** It's crucial that the test data remains entirely independent of both the training and validation data to ensure an unbiased evaluation of the model.

The primary reason for splitting data into these three sets is to ensure that the model's performance is realistically evaluated and that it can generalize well to new, unseen data. Without this division, it's challenging to know if a model is truly learning from the data or if it's just memorizing it (overfitting), which wouldn't be useful in practice. Furthermore, the use of a validation set allows for the fine-tuning of model parameters, leading to better performance. It's also important to keep these datasets separate, as using the test data for model development decisions can lead to over-optimistic results and an inflated assessment of a model's capabilities.
