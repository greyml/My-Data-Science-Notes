### Meaning: 

Granularity refers to the level of detail or specificity at which data is collected, stored, or analyzed. It represents the extent to which data points are broken down into smaller or more specific units. The choice of granularity can significantly impact the insights that can be derived from the data and the types of analysis that can be performed. In data science, finding the right balance of granularity is essential to ensure that the data provides meaningful insights while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
