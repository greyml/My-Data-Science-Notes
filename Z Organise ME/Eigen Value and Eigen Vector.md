$$A*V = \lambda*V$$
$A$ - Square Matrix
$V$ - Vector
$\lambda$ - Scalar Value

If we multiply a square matrix $A$ with vector $V$ and if we get a new vector $\lambda V$
that is $\lambda$ times of vector $V$, then vector $V$ is called eigen vector of matrix A. 

$\lambda V$ does not change the direction of original vector $V$
