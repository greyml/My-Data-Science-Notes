**Stochastic Gradient Boosting, also known as Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with stochastic gradient descent optimization, is an extension of the traditional AdaBoost algorithm.** While both AdaBoost and stochastic gradient boosting belong to the boosting family of machine learning algorithms and aim to create a strong ensemble model by combining weak learners, they differ in several key aspects.

1. Sampling Approach: In AdaBoost, each weak learner is trained on the entire training set with sample weights assigned to emphasize misclassified samples. In contrast, stochastic gradient boosting introduces a stochastic sampling approach. It randomly selects a subset of training samples (with replacement) for each weak learner. This process is called "stochastic gradient descent" as it approximates the gradient using a subset of samples.
    
2. Loss Function Optimization: AdaBoost minimizes the weighted error rate or similar loss functions to find the best decision stump at each iteration. Stochastic gradient boosting, on the other hand, minimizes a differentiable loss function, typically using gradient descent optimization techniques. The loss function represents the discrepancy between the predicted values and the actual target values.
    
3. Learning Rate: AdaBoost assigns a fixed weight (alpha value) to each weak learner, determining its contribution to the final ensemble. In stochastic gradient boosting, a learning rate parameter is introduced, which controls the contribution of each weak learner. The learning rate scales the predictions of weak learners before they are added to the ensemble, allowing for more careful integration of each model.
    
4. Model Complexity: AdaBoost typically uses decision stumps (one-level decision trees) as weak learners. In stochastic gradient boosting, the weak learners are often decision trees, but they can have multiple levels or other parameters that control their complexity. The trees in stochastic gradient boosting are grown sequentially, with each subsequent tree trying to correct the errors made by the previous trees.
    

Overall, stochastic gradient boosting extends the AdaBoost algorithm by introducing stochastic sampling, utilizing gradient descent optimization, incorporating a learning rate, and allowing for more complex weak learners. These modifications aim to improve the model's generalization ability and performance on unseen data, particularly in scenarios with large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces.
