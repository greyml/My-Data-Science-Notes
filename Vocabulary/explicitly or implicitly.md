### Meaning: 
  
When we talk about something being done "explicitly" or "implicitly," we're referring to how a particular action or information is conveyed or executed:

1. **Explicit:** When something is done explicitly, it means it's **done in a clear, obvious, and straightforward manner**. There's no ambiguity or room for interpretation. Explicit actions or information are typically stated or performed directly without any hidden meaning or assumptions.
    
2. **Implicit:** On the other hand, when something is done implicitly, it means it's **conveyed or executed indirectly, often relying on context or assumed knowledge.** Implicit actions or information may not be clearly stated, and the receiver is expected to infer or understand it based on the circumstances.
    

Here are examples to illustrate the difference:

- **Explicit**: Imagine a sign that says, "No Smoking Allowed." This is explicit; it clearly states the prohibition.
    
- **Implicit**: If you enter a restaurant and see people not smoking, even though there's no sign, it's implicit that smoking is not allowed. This information is inferred from the behavior of others and the absence of ashtrays or designated smoking areas.
    

In programming and communication, **being explicit is often favored because it reduces ambiguity and makes it easier for others to understand your code or messages.** However, there are cases where implicit communication or actions are more efficient or make sense within a specific context. The choice between explicit and implicit depends on the situation and the need for clarity.
